# Wireframe/Storyboard

Using the sketches and outline from last week, I developed a story outline to gauge the tone and content for my audience. My intended audience is an Indian voter, specifically the 'swing voter'.  

This project was inspired by water cooler and lunch table conversations at work. More on this in the presentation;) I wished to tell this story then, but I do it now through this project. And I'm excited to see if I successfully convey it.

The hope is that through this story, the voter assesses the consequences of their 'casual' (in terms of absent ideological rigidity) swing vote, and casts the vote consciously.

 My story outline is here - https://preview.shorthand.com/5aLaLGiZpYX4ohfP.

Some of the charts (the unemployment and election result charts), content (on data credibility and unemployment), and pictures (taken from Google images) are borrowed; for now. I will be making them myself. I wanted to test the structure, tone and content in this stage to gauge if I'm telling an effective story. I also need to move at least two of my visualization to Tableau. I will be doing that in part 3.

# User Research 

## Target audience
My story is intended for an Indian voter. 

Given the pertinent subject, it could also be of utility for people beyond the subcontinent's borders. And so, for my user research I tested it on a wider audience, to get a sense of how it feels to an unfamiliar audience. 


## Interview Script
My primary question was to see if the story is conveying what I want to tell. 

The way I approached it was that I requested them to follow the story on Shorthand unguided. I solicited questions and queries as they navigated, as this would tell me what is confusing/missing and needs to be changed.

Once they were done, I asked for overall feedback, if the story was clear, if something was confusing, if something is missing, what would they like me to change. Is the story convincing.

And then I told them the story I want to tell in words, and asked if the same was conveyed just by reading. This was the most pivotal question for me. Is my storyboard conveying the story fully, with as much passion and emotion. 

The real success metric for me is if it will make the 'swing' voter reconsider voting decision. But party alliances, in social environment as tense as India's, is not something you openly discuss. So while I couldn't ask my test-user base what their alliances and idelogies are, I took my chances. As this is what I intend the story, when published, to do. It might be consumed by people on idelogical extremes, and those in the center. Irrespective of that, does it talk to you? For the swing voter, I hope it's influential. For those on either extremes, it's facts you can nod or shrug to.

| Is the story convincing? Does it need more data grounding?        | Is it effective?                      |
| Is it engaging the targeted audience?                             | Is it relevant and engagaing?         | 
| Is any part confusing?                                            | Misses & assumptions on creator's part| 
| Anything you'd like me to change?                                 | Open-ended feedback                   | 
| Could you follow the story?                                       | Flow & narrartive                       | 
| This is what I want to say. Did the story convey the same?        | Successful framing                    |   


## Interview Findings, Synthesis, & Identified Changes for Part III
I hand-picked my test-users with specific intents and goals.

Interview 1: Female. 25. International student. Non Indian.

I chose her for tone and flow testing of my narrative. Also to see how the story feels to an unfamailiar audience ("What is cow vigilantism?" was a question I didn't expect anyone to have)

Interview 2: Male. 25. International student. Indian.

I didn't know the ideological affiliation of this individual. But it seemed that would be as good a  proxy I could get for my target audience.

Interview 3: Male. 27. Indian American.

The Indian diaspora abroad, unless closely following the news, could be cut-off from the lived reality. But they could be emotionally and tangibly involved in the politics of the country. This could be my secondary target auidence. I picked him to test waters on how my story communicates with this group.

**Summary**

The third interview had suggestions on altering the tone. That I should claim and tell the user. Instead of leaving room for them to answer themselves. This would be a significant change. I want the voter to decide for themselves. I feel the story is more effective when they conclude themselves. Feeding my ideas could be ineffective because there is so much of that outside anyway. This was a good observation, but I'll probably choose to continue with the tone I have at the moment. 

The main thing I would like to address from my second interview is the 'give me some numbers to compare' the lynching and communal violence numbers with. This I feel is a good challenge both for the story telling and persoanlly - how do I make the numbers speak for themselves without any comparison. Any life lost is a crime. There shouldn't be a high/low comparison for the gravity to hit the reader.

The first interview made me consider if I should have pages on context setting. This could be one of secondary objectives for part 3.


**Details**


| Interview 1 - Feedback/Questions                 |  Synthesis                       | Anticipated Changes for Part III |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| The financial year in India is from April-March?| Confusing to unfamiliar audience| The text and graph labels should match|
| A page for left-right in India | Introduce political landscape| Will consider if need it|
| What is lynching? Cow vigilantism?| Use 'ethnic cleansing'?|Will refer ethnic cleansing|
| Took some time to understand the election results page| Do I want readers to spend time on it?| Re-visualize/remove|
| Data credibility confusing                            | Is a complicated concept| I assumed concept familairity. Will rephrase it.|
| **Interview 2 -  Feedback/Questions**                  | **Synthesis**                     | **Anticipated Changes for Part III** |
| The lynching numbers should be compared against something | Audience expecting a 'now higher' narrative | As part of propaganda, numbers aren't easily available. I would like to tweak to remove that expectaion, and emphasize the gravity of the number better|
| A resolution page | In my verbal narration I mentioned that absence of strong opposition is one reason for majority votes. The feedback was that I should add a resolution page | This is a good feedback. I need to consider how I want to tailor it |
| **Interview 3 -  Feedback/Questions**                     | **Synthesis**                     |**Anticipated Changes for Part III** |
| My narrative is guided - I'm asking versus claiming | For an audience who isn't aware of all the details, it would be easier to be told | I want the reader to objectiveley assess. While I get the feedback (anticipated that diaspora wouldn't know all the details), my primary audience is still the voter.| 
| I also consciously decided not to call out names. Would be easier for 'unaware' reader to follow  | The suggestion was that it is okay to be subjective and call out. | Again, I want the reader to be able to objectively decided. Subjectivity and name calling would color the reading experience.|


With these useful feedbacks, I'm excited to work on part 3. 
I'm looking forward to finalising charts and incorporating the feedbacks I received.
Happy working to me:)
