# Changes made since Part II
I changed the narrative significantly since Part 2. This was primarily in response to the feedback I received on how partisan topics can disengage audience. 

My primary objective was to make people think about their vote and its power - it's a voice. It's a signal to the parties of what the electorate wants. But often, for lack of political competition, people vote for a party even though they don't approve of all their agendas. With rise of anti-democratic extremist forces around the world, some of these agendas are exclusionary and polarize the society. Voters need to consider what is perceived as their mandate.

I wanted the message to be democratic. Not partisan. And that is what I hope I have achieved in part 3.

The message shifted from 'Cast Consciously' to 'Rethinking Vote'.

This narrative was there in part 2 in undertones. The specific party details were coloring it over. While those details make the argument strong, they shade the narrative with party affiliation and undermine credibility of the narrative. 

The narrative shift also required that some of the party specific and other charts be removed, since they weren't fitting in the story anymore. This helped with 'uncoloring' the tone, but left me with fewer charts, but since the focus of the project is storytelling, I hope it will be okay.

The major tone change aside, other feedbacks from part 2 were also incorporated.

1. One of the most useful feedbacks was for the unemployment page. I earlier planned to have a chart that visualized the unemployment trends over time. The test-review identified that I had more memorable numbers in the text (75 million, 25 million) which make a stronger point.
2. One of the questions I received in initial stages of part 2 and even with current version was that why am I not showing recent GDP numbers. I decided to continue with pre-COVID numbers as then the drop is attributed to COVID.
3. Another useful recommendation I received was to have a resolution page - what can people do? That didn't seem as obvious in the tone I had in part 2. But the refocusing in part 3 help me tailor it in the narrative. And I believe it makes the narrative stronger.

The primary design decision was that I wanted the color tones to be dark themed. Background images (especially in the unemployment and poverty page) to work with the narrative passively. The cover page background image was also chosen for the same reason.

The story guides the user through a dialogue. It asks a question ('Is the thriving popularity of the government in response to its economic performance?', 'If the government failed on key economic targets, why are they popular still?') and then presents a narrative that could be a response to the story. It asks the reader to consider.

The questions - the call outs - to the reader are in yellow.

   
## The audience
This story was inspired by comments I heard amongst my colleagues. They didn't condone the communal violence. But for lack of alternatives would vote for the party nevertheless. This seeded the thought that exceptional times like these need us to identify that our vote could be perceived as a voice against fellow citizens.

The primary audience for me is an Indian voter. But the message is larger. It's about how do we make the democracy stronger. How do we make the government hear. It demands the polity to be engaged. Change can come only then. I used India as an example for contexting and also because it has elections in 2024. But the message is generic and relevant to any reader interested in why violence happens and what can we do.


# Final thoughts
I am most grateful for the feedback for tone change I could do in part 3. I hope I have been successful, if only somewhat.
I could have strengthened the narrative with alternate data, but the time-crunch didn't leave for these considerations.
The narrative shift was a significant change. It felt like I was doing Part 2 again. I would have liked to take user feedback again to identify gaps, but didn't have the time for it.

I wished to embed Tableau charts but didn't like the full-page rendering, and so for design's sake decided to continue with uploaded images.
