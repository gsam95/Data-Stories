# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I really like data.  And I like visualizations.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. But, primarily: 

1. Tell stories effectively
2. Cool like Mona Chalabi
3. Merge my artsy and nerdy side: artist-data-scientist


# Portfolio
Cool stuff loading....
Hang in there
