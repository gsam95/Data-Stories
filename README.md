## Assignment 1: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
Here we used the publicly available Debt-Y Ratio data (https://data.oecd.org/). This data has government debt by country for 1995 - 2021. 
Data Source: “General Government - General Government Debt - OECD Data.” theOECD, http://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm. Accessed 28 Jan. 2024. 

We analyze the data using 3 different visualizations:
1. The first visual analyzes the metric for 2020 across countries and also how it compares to OECD average. Placed in an ascending order, countries to the right of this marker (OECD Average) have high debt-Y ratio compared to OECD average and vice-versa.
2. The heat-map presents a comprehensive view of the Debt-GDP ratio's movement across countries over the years. The color scale makes tracking easy for each country: blue to orange shows country moving from a good state to bad state and vice versa.
3. The third visual considers last 5 years' average for only European countries to help EU leaders identify and focus on countries overdrawing (in red).

Comparing the 3 visuals:
1. The first visual would be relevant in the annual OECD country meet. It clearly shows countries that are doing worse than OECD average. A color scale variation (blue-red for good-worse) could have been useful but the current graph conveys the same information without adding color-noise. If the presenter wants audience to focus on specific countries (like say Japan, Italy, Greece - that are doing worst), highlighting only these and others in grey would have been useful.
2. The heatmap is useful to analyse year-year movement and also identify countries that might be starting on a spiral. The easy and intuitive color variation can also help identify countries that got out of debt; Japan, Greece can learn from the steps taken by these countries.
3. The third visual was created for EU leaders only. Bar chart with intuitive color scale was chosen to draw attention to countries that need focus.
   

Finally, use Markdown to write a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful.
